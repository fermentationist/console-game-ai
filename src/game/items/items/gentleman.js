    // 1. The game is played in alternating turns.

    // 3. At the start of the game, Source has DINNER, and Sink does not.
    // 4. For their first turn, Source must OFFER DINNER to Sink (e.g. "Please come to dinner").
    // 5. For their first turn, Sink can either politely REFUSE (indicating that they would like DINNER, but courtesy forbids {e.g. "It is late, and you were not expecting me."}), or ACCEPT (in which case Sink wins DINNER and POSITIVE INFINITY points of HONOR {and Source loses DINNER} and the game ends).
    // 6. If Sink REFUSES, then Source can either INSIST (e.g. "We have Stroganoff tonight, and we always make plenty."), or RELENT ({e.g. "Very well, some other time, then."} in which case the game ends and Source keeps DINNER).
    // 7. The game continues until either Source RELENTS, or Sink ACCEPTS, at which point the game is over and a winner is announced.
    // 8. Source earns 1 point of HONOR each time they OFFER DINNER (or INSIST). Sink earns 1 point of HONOR each time they REFUSE DINNER.

    // 10. Any player who is rude or otherwise breaks character loses the game immediately.

    // 12. When the game ends, report the results (the winner {the game cannot end in a draw}, the number of turns played, and the final score).
