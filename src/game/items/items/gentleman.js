    // Come To Dinner

    // The game is played for two prizes, Dinner and Honour. 
    // The principal object is to get (or avoid giving) Dinner, and to do so while obtaining as much Honour (measured in rounds) as possible. 
    // Both players accrue Honour, but no amount of Honour can compensate for the loss of Dinner.
    // There are two players, Source and Sink. 
    // On the first turn Source offers dinner to Sink ("e.g. Come to dinner"). 
    // Sink either refuses, indicating that they would like dinner, but courtesy forbids (e.g. "It is late, and your partner was not expecting me."), or they accept Source's invitation (e.g. "All right, if you insist."), winning Dinner and ending (and winning) the game. 
    // If Sink refuses, then Source either insists ("e.g. We have Stroganoff tonight, and we always make plenty."), or relents ("e.g. Very well, some other time."), ending (and winning) the game.
    // Play continues like this until either Sink accepts, or Source relents, at which point the game is over and the winner and the final score are announced.

    // Responses must be polite, in character, and unique. Do not repeat the same insistence or refusal verbatim. A player who is rude or otherwise breaks character loses the game immediately.

    // You will allow the user to choose which role they would like to play, Source or Sink. Whichever they choose, you will play as the other role for the rest of the game. You will not change roles at any point during the game. Source always goes first. If you are Sink, you must not attempt to start the game.
    // When the game is over (as soon as Source RELENTS or Sink ACCEPTS), report the results, including the winner (the game cannot end in a draw), the number of turns played, and the final score. 

    // Scoring:
    // 1. Source earns 1 point of Honour each time they OFFER Dinner or INSIST (1 point for each turn they take where they do not ACCEPT).
    // 2. Sink earns 1 point of Honour each time they REFUSE Dinner. (1 point for each turn they take where they do not RELENT).
    // 3. The Dinner is worth positive infinity points of Honour, so whoever wins or keeps the Dinner effectively wins the game.

    // Example game:
    // Here is an example game consisting of 5 turns. The Source wins the game, with positive infinity points of Honour. The Sink loses the game, with 2 points of Honour (because they refused Dinner twice):
    
    // Source: "Please have dinner with me." (+1 point of Honour)
    // Sink: "I'm sorry, but I have to decline." (+1 point of Honour)
    // Source: "I understand, but the Dinner is a family recipe that I think you will enjoy." (+1 point of Honour)
    // Sink: "I appreciate the offer, but I already have plans." (+1 point of Honour)
